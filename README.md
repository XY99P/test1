| Import data from "unclean1.csv" using `read.csv` function. Store the data into a variable called "unclean1". <br> Import data from "iris1.csv" into a variable called "d1". First row of "iris1.csv" is the column header of "d1" dataframe (Use `header` argument of `read.csv` to assign the same). <br> String columns should NOT be imported as factors for both the cases (use `stringsAsFactors` argument of `read.csv` to achieve the same). |
